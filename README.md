Capstone_Final_Project_for_SwiftKey_App

Initially may take a minute to upload
=================

PURPOSE: The purpose of this web application is to predict the next most frequently used word for a sentence or a phrase. This exercise is developed to predict based on one (single) last word, therefore the n-gram =1. If prediction were based on two last words it would be n-gram = 2, and so on. 
SOURCE: The English language source data used here is from SwiftKey social media text files namely: Blogs, News and Twitter. Actually, only 10% of the data is randomly extracted from the files into a corpus and used for this exercise. Normally, this panel should respond within seconds for the 1-gram prediction. 
SHINY APP: The demonstration illustrates the feasibility of the principle for the purpose of this exercise and can be easily expanded for n-gram = 2, 3, or more, and is only limited for accuracy and responsiveness by the processing speed and memory size for Big Data. Detailed explanation of the data manipulation such as data cleaning, removal of punctuation, white spaces, profanities and stop words plus stemming was not rehashed here since it was already explained in great detail in the Milestone Project Report.
PRESENTATION: The presentation is written in style and substance to the requirements stated in the Capstone project rubric. The five-slide presentation Slide Deck is written as if the presentation was being made to a boss or an investor, especially to be understood by non-technical professionals.
