Capstone_Final_Project_for_SwiftKey_App

At first the app may take about 60 seconds to upload
=================

The purpose of this web application is to predict the next most frequently used word for a sentence or a phrase. This exercise is developed to predict based on one last word, therefore the n-gram =1. If prediction were based on two last words it would be n-gram = 2, and so on. 
The English language source data used here is from SwiftKey text files namely: Blogs, News and Twitter. Actually, only 10% of the data is randomly extracted and assembled in a corpus for this exercise. Normally, this panel should respond within 15 seconds for 1-gram prediction. 
This demonstration illustrates the feasibility of the principle for the purpose of this exercise and can be easily expanded for n-gram = 2, 3, or more and is only limited for accuracy and responsiveness by the processing speed and memory size for big data.
